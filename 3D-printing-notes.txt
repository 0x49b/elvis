3D PRINTING NOTES:

	Printing temperatures may required tweaks depending on ambient temperature and local air circulation.
	
	Printers used Voron 2.4 and Voron 0.1

			Layer Height: 0.2mm	
			Cooling: disabled
			Infill: 20%
			Minimum Layer Time: 30s (slicer default)
			
		Frame:
			First layer speed: 20mm/s

		Upper leg:
			The upper leg is made from two pieces, the upper leg and the gear interface.
			A ring bearing connects the gear interface and the leg bridge via a press fit.
			Therefore the dimensionally acuracy of the gear interface is important to ensure a proper fit.
			The gear interface connects and the upper leg connect together by a loose fit and welded with cyanoacrylate (super glue).
			The purpose of using two pieces is to allow for quicker reprinting gear interface dimensional accuracy test prints.
