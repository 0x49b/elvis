3D PRINTING NOTES





Upper leg:
	The upper leg is made from two pieces, the upper leg and the gear interface.
	A ring bearing connects the gear interface and the leg bridge via a press fit.
	Therefore the dimensionally acuracy of the gear interface is important to ensure a proper fit.
	The gear interface connects and the upper leg connect together by a loose fit and welded with cyanoacrylate (super glue).
	The purpose of using two pieces is to allow for quicker reprinting gear interface dimensional accuracy test prints.

	Gear interface 3D printer settings to compensate for shrinkage and warp due to temperature issues for small parts:
		(Using Cura, eSUN brown ABS filament, and a Voron 2.4 3D printer)
		Enable Print Cooling: Enabled
		Fan Speed: 25%
		Initial Fan SPeed: 0%
		Minimum Layer Time: 30 seconds
		Scale the part in Cura to 100.3% (you final value my differ due to material differences)

	Gear interface 3D printer settings to compensate for shrinkage:
		Enable Print Cooling: Disabled
		Minimum Layer Time: default (15 seconds)
		Scale the part in Cura to 100.56% (you final value my differ due to material differences)
