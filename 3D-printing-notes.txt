3D PRINTING NOTES:

	Printing settings are tuned to the filament and printers used to create the orginal Zuko.
	Settings likley will need adjustment to match your filament, printers, ambient temperature, etc.
	Naming convention follows Cura slicer.
			
	Printers:
		Voron 2.4:
			Large parts
		Voron 0.1:
			Small parts
	
	All servo drive gears should not need to be forced into their interfaces; adjust scaling accordingly.
	
	Most parts should printed in ABS for heat resistance properties (direct sunlight). 
	Other materials such as ASA, carbon fiber, and polycarbonate may also work but are untested.
	Some parts may be printed in PLA for convenience such as electronic mounting plates.
	Feet and tail are printed in TPU filament.
