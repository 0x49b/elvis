3D PRINTING NOTES:

	Printing settings are tuned to the filament and printers used; settings likley will need some adjustment to match your filament, printers, ambient temperature, etc.
			
	Printers:
		Voron 2.4:
			Large parts
		Voron 0.1:
			Small parts
	
	Servo drive gears should not need to be forced into their interfaces.
