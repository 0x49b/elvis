3D PRINTING NOTES:

	Frame v2.1 (notes are currently being adjusted to reflect v2.1)

	Printing settings are tuned to the filament and printers used to create the orginal Zuko.
	Settings likley will need adjustment to match your filament, printers, ambient temperature, etc.
	Slicer configuration naming convention follows the Cura slicer nomenclature.
			
	Printers:
		Voron 2.4:
			Large parts
		Voron 0.1:
			Small parts
		
	Filaments:
		ABS:
			Black: 
				eSun ABS+
			Brown: 
				eSun ABS
			White: 
				eSun ABS
		TPU:
			White: 
				Overature TPU
		PLA
			Black: 
				Overture Matte Black PLA
	
	Most parts should printed in ABS for heat resistance properties (direct sunlight). 
	Other materials such as ASA, carbon fiber, and polycarbonate may also work but are untested.
	Some parts may be printed in PLA for convenience such as electronic mounting plates.
	Feet and tail are printed in TPU filament.
		
	The upper leg bearing interface is a press fit, scaling trial and error is likely to acheive a tight press fit.
		
TIPS & TRICKS:
	Note:
		These adjustems taken during printing to increase print quality for the given printers, filament, and environment.
	Shrinking parts:
		ABS will shrink and parts likely will need to be scaled during slicing to match your brand of ABS.
	Prevent lifted corners:
		ABS must be printed in an enclosure free from air current, with a high bed temperature, and (in many cases) an enabled cooling fan.
	Smoother top layers for better fits:
		Top surface skin layers: 2
		Top surface skin flow: 90%
	Cleaner TPU surfaces:
		Reduced temperature.
