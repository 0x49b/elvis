# Frame Versions

Select the latest version if you intend to make or redesign your own robot dog.

### v2.1 Change Log

	25t spline to gear adapters replaced with common servo horn to increase part accessibility and to reduce cost. Suggested by SnowGliderr.
	Upper leg, lower leg servo horn, and hips redesigned to accept new servo horn.
	Frame bridge added top/bottom flair outs for aesthetics.
	Single unit electronics mounting plate for expansion board mounting direct to RPi4.
	Minor tweaks applied during assembly.
	
### v2 Change Log

	Replaced hip drive belts with direct drive by relocating hip motors into the electronics bay.
	Updated front and back center frames to support direct drive.
	Lengthened frame sides to accommodate space requirements for direct drive.
	Revised frame bridge from two peices into one to accommodate the removal of the hip servos. 
	Added ring bearing to upper leg and leg linkage bridge.
	Converted upper leg into two components, upper leg and gear interface, to accommodate the ring bearing's press fit joint.
	Revised hip joint pulley to accommodate direct drive.
	Added more support to the hip pulley connection area.
	Added more material support around lower leg linkage connection point.
	Revised lower leg to include a flair at the paw area.
	Removed brass insert requirement from hips, now using course threaded screws.
	Relocated power switch with stury direct frame connection.

	Results: 
		Pros:
			Fewer 3D printed parts, filament types, and hardware.
			No friction bearings.
			No stretchy hip angles.
			No leg assembly bridge wobble.
		Cons:			
			5mm longer frame resulting electronics bay space reduction (but electronics able to be housed in frame bridge)
