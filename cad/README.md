Change log from v1 to v2:

	Replaced hip drive belts with direct drive by relocating hip motors into the electronics bay.
	Updated front and back center frames to support direct drive.
	Lengthened frame sides to accommodate space requirements for direct drive.
	Revised frame bridge from two peices into one to accommodate the removal of the hip servos. 
	Added ring bearing to upper leg and leg linkage bridge.
	Converted upper leg into two components, upper leg and gear interface, to accommodate the ring bearing's press fit joint.

	Results: 
		Pros:
			Fewer 3D printed parts, filament types, and hardware.

			No stretchy hip angles.
			No leg assembly bridge wobble.
		Cons:			
			5mm longer frame resulting electronics bay space reduction (but electronics able to be housed in frame bridge)
