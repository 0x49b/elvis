# Frame Versions

Change log from v1 to v2:

	Replaced hip drive belts with direct drive by relocating hip motors into the electronics bay.
	Updated front and back center frames to support direct drive.
	Lengthended frame sides to accommodate space requirements for direct drive.
	Revised frame bridge from two peices into one to accommodate the removal of the hip servos. 
	Added ring bearing to upper leg and leg linkage bridge.
	Converted upper leg into two components, upper leg and gear interface, to accommodate the ring bearing's press fit joint.
	Revised hip joint pulley to accommodate direct drive.
	Added more support to the hip pulley connection area.
	Added more material support around lower leg linkage connection point.
	Revised lower leg to include a flair at the paw area.
	Removed brass insert requirement from hips, now using course threaded screws.
	
	Results: 
		Pros:
			fewer parts (3D printed and hardware), no friction bearings, non-stretchy hip angles.
		Cons:
			5mm longer frame resulting electronics bay space reduction (but electronics able to be housed in frame bridge)
